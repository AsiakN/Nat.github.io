  <h1>About</h1>
  <p><strong>I began life as a small child.</strong>In that period, I played soccer mostly, tended to a couple of chicks, roamed the fields.</p>

  <p>I studied Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://acity.edu.gh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Academic City College</a>. I was privileged to have worked with amazing colleagues on the control systems/firmware  
    of emergency-use ventilators. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-52618837">I spoke about our work on BBC Africa</a>.</p>

  <p> I am currently working as a software engineer <a href="https://jetstreamafrica.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">@JetstreamAfrica</a> powering real-time logistics visibility. These days, I am mostly working on finetuning, and deploying large language models into products, and workflows.
  Previously, I have worked on products that allow payments, financing requests, and a 360-degree view  on shipments, and their processes. I did most of my internships here building strong capabilities in software testing</p>
  
  <p>Throughout my four years at Academic City College, I joined a couple of clubs, and social-initiative focused organisationss, which gave me the proudest moments of my life.
    I remember making 2-hour weekly commutes during vacations to less-privileged high schools around my college to teach maths, and science. The joy on the faces of the students was very infectious. Those are some of the best times for me! </p>

  <p>You’ve read this far – astounding! I’m very impressed. Thanks for not finding me entirely boring :) </p>
